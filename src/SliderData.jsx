        paragrafOne: `The hit Formula 1 documentary series Drive to Survive has picked up another prestigious award, after winning an Emmy on Tuesday.
                    The Netflix programme won the “Outstanding Sports Documentary Series – Serialised” category at the Sports Emmy’s for Series 6, which covered the 2023 F1 season.

                    It's the second time the Box to Box Films-produced show has won this award, after also picking it up in 2022.
                    Since launching with the first series back in 2019, Drive To Survive has become a massive global hit, with a cumulative audience of over 700 million people.`,
        paragrafTwo: `Series 6 covered Max Verstappen's third championship triumph in a dominant year for the Dutchman when he won 19 of the 22 Grands Prix across the season and romped home to the title.
                    “Obviously you’re not talking about a season where there’s a massive title rivalry, so really it’s interesting watching the fight for second, third, fourth taking place,” Executive Producer James Gay-Rees told Formula1.com at the time.
                    "We went into it slightly worried that because Red Bull were so dominant it might be a little bit skinny, but actually it’s not. We even nearly did more episodes than we normally do because we had quite a lot of stories to tell.
                    “I get for the casual viewer that it may get a bit repetitive with Max winning every weekend, but I do think, in hindsight, people are going to understand what an amazing driver he is."
                    Series 7 of Drive to Survive was released in March of this year, and all seven seasons are available to watch now on Netflix.`,
