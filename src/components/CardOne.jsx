                    <b>Red Bull driver Max Verstappen delivered another masterclass to take victory in the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix and keep the pressure on his McLaren rivals on Sunday. But who else caught the attention of our judges across an action-packed Imola weekend? Check out the latest Power Rankings scores and overall leaderboard below...</b>

                    <h2>How it works</h2>

                    Our five-judge panel assess each driver after every Grand Prix and score them out of 10 according to their performance across the weekend – taking machinery out of the equation

                    Our experts’ scores are then averaged out to produce a race score – with those scores then tallied up across the season on our overall Power Rankings Leaderboard.
