        <p><b>Ferrari had a much better Sunday in Imola than Saturday, getting both cars home well into the points. Lewis Hamilton rose from 12th on the grid to fourth at the flag, with Charles Leclerc sixth. But having watched both cars exit in Q2 in Qualifying, team boss Fred Vasseur is under no illusions where their problems lie.</b>

          <br/>
          Bar that one astonishing pole for Hamilton in Sprint Qualifying back in China, one-lap pace has been an issue all year for the Scuderia. Leclerc has a best Qualifying result of third, while Hamilton’s best starting slot for a Grand Prix is fifth.

          And while they both rose through the field at Imola, repeating that feat at Monaco this weekend will be a much taller order, given the difficulty of overtaking in the Principality.
