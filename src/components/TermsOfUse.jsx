        <br />
        <h2>Individual Arbitration & Class Action Waiver for U.S. Residents:</h2>
        <br />
        <p>The following terms apply to U.S. residents only:</p>
        <br />
        <p>You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy with us or our agents arising out of or relating in any way to the Site and all other official Formula 1 digital products related to the Site, including but not limited to the F1TV digital subscription products (the “Services”), these Terms, the Subscription Terms, and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Except that, nothing in this provision shall prevent us from seeking and obtaining an injunction or other equitable relief from a court in the event of a breach or threatened breach of these terms and conditions.</p>
        <br />
        <p>You agree that, by agreeing to these terms and conditions, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement, and that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your F1TV subscription and/or account.</p>
        <br />
        <p>If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim ("Notice of Dispute") by certified mail to Dispute Resolution Legal Department, Formula One Digital Media Limited, No. 2 St. James's Market, London, United Kingdom, SW1Y 4AH. The Notice of Dispute must contain enough information for us to identify your account and attempt to resolve your claim, including (a) the name of the F1TV account holder; (b) subscription account number; (c) the email address you used to subscribe; and (d) a written description of the problem, relevant documents and supporting information and a statement of the specific relief you are seeking, and it must be signed by you. If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The arbitrator is bound by these terms and conditions. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement. Any arbitration will be conducted pursuant to the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced. If there is any conflict between the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and these terms and conditions, the terms and conditions shall take precedence. Unless we agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your residence or at another mutually agreed upon location permitted by the arbitrator. Both parties reserve the right to request a hearing from the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules and applicable law.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Severability. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that any part of this arbitration provision cannot be enforced with respect to any claim, remedy, or request for relief, the rest of this arbitration provision will continue to apply. If, however, this Class Action Waiver is declared to be unenforceable or invalid, this entire arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply to that claim, remedy, or request for relief (but will still apply to any and all other claims, remedies, and requests for relief that you or we may assert in that or any other action). In any such case, you and we agree that we will arbitrate all claims, remedies, and requests for relief subject to individual arbitration first, and that any remaining unresolved claims, remedies, or requests for relief may be pursued in court only after the arbitrator’s award has been issued. In any such proceeding, the arbitrator’s factual findings will not be entitled to deference by the court.</p>
        <br />
        <p>30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to us within 30 days after first accepting the Terms of Use to the following address: Attention: Dispute Resolution Legal Department, Formula One Digital Media Limited, No. 2 St. James Market, London, SW1Y 4AH.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Your opt-out notice must include your name and address email address you used to transact on the Site (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement, including the class action waiver, will continue to apply to you, unless precluded by law. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p>
        <br />
