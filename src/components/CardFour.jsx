          <b>McLaren may well have the fastest overall package this year, but Max Verstappen proved on Sunday that he's in no mood to concede anything to his papaya rivals, pulling off one of the all-time great overtaking moves on pole-sitter Oscar Piastri into Tamburello to take the lead on Lap 1.
            <br/>
            That stunning move was the foundation of Verstappen's victory as he raced off at the front, while behind him there was plenty of action – and a surprising amount of overtaking on such a tight track – as the rest of the drivers fought for places.</b>
